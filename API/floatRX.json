      "method": "Switch to the longer 20-gauge needle, and administer 4-5 mL of lidocaine along the catheter insertion tract (see the image below). Make sure to anesthetize all the way down to the peritoneum. The authors recommend alternating injection and intermittent aspiration down the tract until ascitic fluid is noticed in the syringe. Note the depth at which the peritoneum is entered. In obese patients, reaching the peritoneum may involve passing through a significant amount of adipose tissue",
      "complications": "Failed attempt to collect peritoneal fluid. Persistent leak from the puncture site. Wound infection. Abdominal wall hematoma. Spontaneous hemoperitoneum. This rare complication is due to mesenteric variceal bleeding after removal of a large amount of ascitic fluid. Hollow viscus perforation (small or large bowel, stomach, bladder). Catheter laceration and loss in abdominal cavity. Laceration of major blood vessel (aorta, mesenteric artery, iliac artery). Postparacentesis hypotension. Dilutional hyponatremia. Hepatorenal syndrome"

      "indications": "Radiation therapy may be used on its own to treat prostate cancer or a tumor of the larynx. Radiation therapy may be carried out before or during cancer surgery to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to reduce the risk that all cancer cells have not been removed. Relieving pressure or blockage by reducing tumor size. Treating symptoms of brain cancer, such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Reducing symptoms of lung cancer, such as chest pain and breathlessness controlling ulcerating tumors, bleeding, and infections",
      "method": "In external radiation therapy, a machine called a linear accelerator is used to emit X-rays within a specific energy range. Other machines are also available that use other forms of energy, including electrons, protons, gamma rays, or a combination of these. Internal radiation therapy involves an implant of metal tubes, wires, or seeds that can be placed inside the body without surgery. In some cases, surgery may be needed to locate the implant nearer to the cancer.",
      "complications": "Fatigue or Lethargy, skin irritation, including swelling, blisters, and a sunburned or tanned appearance. Effects specific to the area of treatment, such as hair loss, urinary problems, nausea,vomiting, and diarrhea. Tissue inflammation, such as esophagitis, pneumonitis, and hepatitis. Rarely, a drop in the number of white blood cells or platelets"

Assess FHR after: admission of patient; artificial or spontaneous rupture of membranes; vaginal examination; abnormal uterine activity; or evaluation of analgesia or anesthesia",
      "method": "Palpate the abdomen to determine the position of the fetus (Leopold maneuvers). Place the Doppler over the area of maximal intensity of fetal heart tones. Differentiate maternal pulse from fetal pulse. Palpate for uterine contraction during period of FHR auscultation to determine relationship. Count FHR between contractions for â‰¥ 60 seconds to determine average baseline rate. Count FHR after uterine contraction for 60 seconds (at 5-second intervals) to identify fetal response to active labor (this may be subject to local protocols)",

      "method": "Haemodialysis (HD) involves circulating blood through a disposable dialyser. The vascular access of choice is the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). This, however, requires suitable peripheral veins and needs four to eight weeks for the fistula to mature. If there are no suitable veins, a graft can usually be inserted. Acute access with venous catheters has a high complication rate.Peritoneal dialysis (PD) involves using the peritoneum as the dialysis membrane, with pre-packaged fluid being instilled into the peritoneal space via a Tenckhoff catheter. This is usually only inserted once the decision to start dialysis is made.",
      "complications": "Bleeding. Vessel damage. Bloodstream or localised infection. Air embolis. Hypoxia. Haemodynamic instability Hypocapnea. Hypothermia. Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. Electrolyte disturbance. Hypocalcemia with citrate toxicity. Complications related to anticoagulation"

      "method": "The cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. The cystoscope is a thin, lighted tube with lenses. Most often it is bendable, but some models are rigid. Water or saline is infused through the cystoscope into the bladder. As the fluid fills the bladder, the bladder wall is stretched so the urologist can see clearly.",
      "complications": "Infection. Rarely, cystoscopy can introduce germs into your urinary tract, causing infection. Bleeding. Cystoscopy might cause some blood in your urine. Pain. You might experience abdominal pain and a burning sensation when urinating."
